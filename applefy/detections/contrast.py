        Calculates the
        `contrast grid  <../02_user_documentation/02_contrast_grid.ipynb>`_ .
        The contrast grid shows the detection uncertainty as a function of
        separation from the star and fake planet flux_ratio. It evaluates the
        fake planet residuals directly.
        Compared to the function :meth:`~compute_analytic_contrast_curve` this
        function is applicable not only to residuals of linear PSF-subtraction
        methods like PCA, but in general.
        This allows to compare results of different methods.
        The results are computed using multiprocessing.

        Args:
            statistical_test: The test used to constrain the planet flux
                needed in order to be counted as a detection.
                For the classical TTest (Gaussian noise) use an instance of
                :meth:`~applefy.statistics.parametric.TTest`. For Laplacian
                noise use
                :meth:`~applefy.statistics.bootstrapping.LaplaceBootstrapTest`.
            num_cores: Number of parallel jobs used during multiprocessing.
            num_rot_iter: Number of tests performed with different positions of
                the noise values. See
                `Figure 10 <../04_apples_with_apples/paper_experiments/10_Rotation.ipynb>`_
                for more information.
            safety_margin: Area around the planet [pixel] which is excluded from
                the noise. This can be useful in case the planet has negative
                wings. Can be set to -1. In this case the noise is extracted
                from the residual without the fake planet.
            compute_snr_grid: If set to True the grid values contain the SNR
                instead of the fpf.
            confidence_level_fpf: If set to a float value the output contrast
                grid will be interpolated in order to obtain a contrast curve.
                The value is the confidence level associated with the
                contrast curve as false-positive fraction (FPF).
                If None only the contrast grid is returned. This option is only
                available if compute_snr_grid is set to False.

        Returns:
            1. A pandas DataFrame with the contrast grid. We report the median
            p-value over all num_rot_iter experiments performed.

            2. A pandas DataFrame with the contrast curve obtained by
            thresholding the contrast grid. We report the median
            p-values over all num_rot_iter experiments performed. Only returned
            if a confidence_level_fpf is given and compute_snr_grid is set to
            False.
